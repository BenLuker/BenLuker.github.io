  description: For my 10 week internship at JPL, I established an automated testing framework with Robot Framework to help
               with generating reports for every sprint. 50+ manual test cases were converted to the automated system, and
               running the tests updated their Testrail counterparts automatically with the results using its API.

- title: Software Computing System Undergraduate, Jet Propulsion Laboratory

  description: After my internship, I was offered a part-time position to take place during school. During this time, I was
               given the opportunity to work directly on the web-based Unity project I had previously created tests for. On
               this project, I coded features and enhancements as well as removed bugs and reduced dependencies for better project
               performance with C# and JavaScript. Additionally, I implemented user interfaces with Unity and React.
