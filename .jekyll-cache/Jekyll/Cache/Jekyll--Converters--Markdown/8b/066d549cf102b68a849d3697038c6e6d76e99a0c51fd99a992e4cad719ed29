    In my class Media Environments, we learned how to projection map onto complex objects in a program called TouchDesigner.
    For our midterm we had to project onto a model of our faces! We spent a couple weeks scanning our faces, getting them milled, and projecting onto them.
    Then we had a week to come up with 4 visualizations that each represented an emotion. Despite the short timeframe, I think it turned out alright!

    The face model was scanned using an Xbox Kinect. Once my face was scanned, I cleaned up the mesh in 3D Coat which allowed me to bring it into TouchDesigner and use both as an
    object for projection, and in the content I was projecting onto it (like the wireframe effect). Additionally, we were encouraged to make our projects either reactive or interactive in some way.
    The first visualization I made reacted to music. And although not present in the video, the second and third visualizations would react as a user got closer to and farther
    from a kinect camera stationed right next to the display.
