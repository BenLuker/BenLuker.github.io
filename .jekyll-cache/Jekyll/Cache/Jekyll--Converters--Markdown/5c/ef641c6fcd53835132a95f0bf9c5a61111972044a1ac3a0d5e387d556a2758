I"û<p>For the Spring semester of 2020, I took a course titled Intro to 3D Worlds. The class was about developing 3D models
    and then bringing them into the real world through the process of milling, laser cutting, and 3D printing. Then
    Corona virus happened and everyone was stuck in quarantine. From that point, the class shifted to entirely creating
    3D models and at the last minute, animating them. Our final assignment for the class was to create a still life in
    Maya and animate it. Because the class had just been introduced to Maya, the example our professor had provided us
    looked something like this. </p>

<p> We were given a couple weeks to finish the assignment which was ample time to complete the project. However, I was
    already familiar with Maya, so I
    decided that I wanted to hold myself to a higher standard and push my limits. I had two ideas I wanted to do.
    Firstly, when creating the tablecloth through the nCloth simulation in Maya, I loved watching the cloth simulating
    and becoming a tablecloth. I wanted my animation to capture that feeling of it all coming together in that same way
