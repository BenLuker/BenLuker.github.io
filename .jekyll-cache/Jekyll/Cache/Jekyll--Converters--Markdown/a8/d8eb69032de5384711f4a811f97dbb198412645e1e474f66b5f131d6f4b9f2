I"<p class="blurb">Troubadour is a project I worked on with a team of 10 students to make a game over the course of a semester.
    I was one 3 programmers and it was my job to create the rhythm gameplay portion of the game.
    It was my first time making a game with a team of people. The game is a little rough around the edges but it was a great learning experience!

<p>Troubadour is a small 2D Rhythm Game RPG. Take the role of upcoming robotic musician, Haywire. In the day, busk for
    change, advertise yourself on social media, and buy new instruments that add different layers of gameplay. At night,
    perform at different venues and sell instruments to a shady robot named Legman? Do you have what it takes to make it
    in the human-dominated music industry of Bardopolis? </p>
