I"±<p class="blurb">For the school spring semester of 2020, I took a course titled Intro to 3D Worlds. The class was about developing 3D
    models and then bringing them into the real world through the process of milling, laser cutting, and 3D printing.
    However, once everyone was locked away in quarantine, the class shifted to entirely creating
    3D models, and at the last minute, animating them. Our final assignment for the class was to create a still life in
    Maya and animate it in about a week. Already knowing a bit of Maya, I decided to challenge myself and go for something as high quality as I can.
    And I'm happy with the results!
