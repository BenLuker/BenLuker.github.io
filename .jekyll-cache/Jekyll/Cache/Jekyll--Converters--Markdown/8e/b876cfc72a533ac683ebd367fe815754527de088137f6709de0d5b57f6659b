I"~<p>For the Spring semester of 2020, I took a course titled Intro to 3D Worlds. The class was about developing 3D models
    and then bringing them into the real world through the process of milling, laser cutting, and 3D printing. Then
    Corona virus happened and everyone was stuck in quarantine. From that point, the class shifted to entirely creating
    3D models and at the last minute, animating them. Our final assignment for the class was to create a still life in
    Maya and animate it. Because the class had just been introduced to Maya, the example our professor had provided us
    looked something like this. </p>

<p> We were given a couple weeks to finish the assignment which was ample time to complete the project. However, I was
    already familiar with Maya, so I
    decided that I wanted to hold myself to a higher standard and push my limits. As I started, I discovered what I
    wanted the animation to be.</p>

<p> Firstly, I wanted my scene to <i>look</i> like a still life. You know what I'm talking about. Wooden table with a
    white tablecloth. Dark background and crazy reflections in the surfaces. And who can forget the fruit?
</p>

<p> Now that's a Still Life baby! So that's where I started. I modeled and unwrapped the table in Maya, then moved it
    over to Substance Painter to texture it. Then I brought it back into maya to drape the tablecloth over it. This was
    my second biggest inspiration for the project. It looked really cool to see the simulation of the tablecloth draping
    over the table and thought "hey, why don't I make the whole animation like this?" So that's what I did! I made the
    rest of the objects, learned about Maya's bullet physic simulations, cached those
    simulations and I had something looking pretty sweet. </p>

<p> <i>But that was not good enough.</i> Funnily enough, things move pretty fast when you drop them. When I had the
    timing I wanted down, I realized I had only filled half of the mandatory 15 second length requirement. But if I
    extended the timings there would be too much dead time in between each action. What could I do? After consulting
    with my professor, I suggested that I could make it loop. He said as long as it was seamless that I should be fine.
    And so I did that! That was probably the hardest part about everything. I had many instances where the reflections
    did not look the same when the camera jumped back to the beginning frame. But in the end I was able to work it all
    out.</p>

<p>When creating
the tablecloth through
the nCloth simulation in Maya, I loved watching the cloth simulating
and becoming a tablecloth. I wanted my animation to capture that feeling of it all coming together in that same way
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</p>
