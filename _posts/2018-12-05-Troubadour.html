<p>Troubadour is a small 2D Rhythm Game RPG. Take the role of upcoming robotic musician, Haywire. In the day, busk for
    change, advertise yourself on social media, and buy new instruments that add different layers of gameplay. At night,
    perform at different venues and sell instruments to a shady robot named Legman? Do you have what it takes to make it
    in the human-dominated music industry of Bardopolis? </p>

<p>Troubadour is a project I worked on with a small team of students to make a game over the course of a semester. Of
    the 10 students working on the project, I was one of the 3 programmers. It was my job to create the rhythm game
    portion of the game.</p>
